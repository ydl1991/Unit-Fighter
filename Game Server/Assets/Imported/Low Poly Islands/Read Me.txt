Hello and thank you for purchasing Low Poly Islands Package.

NOTE: You need to have Unity Standard Assets/Environment imported to your project in order for the water prefabs to work properly. 

There are 43 fbx files made 67 to prefabs.

Most of the prefabs are set to static.

Models have separate parts for animation kept in mind.

Texture is 512*512 png

Water used for the screenshots is from Unitys Standard Assets.
